This backend for movie search app is  built with Express.js and Node.js and is connected to a MongoDB database. Backend handles user registration, login and authentication. User data is protected with bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token-based authentication. REST API endpoints offer functionality to register new users and authenticate existing users. MongoDB is used to store user credentials, and middleware features ensure that only authorized requests access protected resources. The application supports CORS and uses the body parser to handle incoming JSON requests.
